                <p>The Spring/Summer 2019 shows, which happened towards the tail end of last year, were many, many
                    things. While the
                    majority of designers continued with the memo ‘you do you’, what united them was their search for an
                    expression of
                    female empowerment.</p>

            <p>The question of how designers envision women, what a woman wears and the image she projects has become a
                political hot
                potato. The big takeaway from the season? To value those visions that really are attuned to reflecting
                our truth in some
                way so that we can do us.</p>
