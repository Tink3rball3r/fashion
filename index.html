                    <p>The Spring/Summer 2019 shows, which happened towards the tail end of last year, were many, many
                        things. While the
                        majority of designers continued with the memo ‘you do you’, what united them was their search
                        for an
                        expression of
                        female empowerment.</p>

                <p>The question of how designers envision women, what a woman wears and the image she projects has
                    become a
                    political hot
                    potato. The big takeaway from the season? To value those visions that really are attuned to
                    reflecting
                    our truth in some
                    way so that we can do us.</p>

                <p>Model discovery stories are mostly myth, but that doesn’t make them any less alluring. It isn’t
                    enough to
                    be beautiful
                    and in search of work, one has to be plucked from obscurity. Oft repeated tales of being chased by
                    scouts at an airport,
                    handed a business card while sipping coffee in Starbucks, or even spotted on Instagram have become
                    the
                    stuff of legend,
                    but what is the reality?</p>
